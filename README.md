# Simple-RNN-Model
This project focuses on understanding the fundamentals of Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs) by building a simple RNN from scratch using Numpy and implementing RNN-based models with the Keras library. The goal is to provide a hands-on experience with RNNs and their applications, particularly in sequential data processing tasks.

OBJECTIVES

Understand the Structure of RNNs: Explore how RNNs process sequential data by maintaining a hidden state that captures information about previous inputs.

Build a Simple RNN with Numpy: Implement the mathematical operations of an RNN to gain insight into its internal workings.

Utilize Keras for RNN-based Models: Leverage the Keras library to build and train more advanced RNN architectures such as SimpleRNN and LSTM.

Apply RNNs to Real-world Data: Use the IMDB dataset to demonstrate how RNNs can be applied to sentiment analysis tasks.

Visualize Training Results: Analyze the performance of RNN models through visualizations of training and validation metrics.

KEY COMPONENTS

1. Simple RNN with Numpy

The first part of the project involves manually implementing a simple RNN using Numpy. This includes defining input data, initializing weights and biases, and performing forward propagation through time. This exercise provides a foundational understanding of how RNNs compute outputs and update their hidden states.

2. Building RNN Models with Keras

The project then transitions to using the Keras library to simplify the process of building and training RNN models. Several examples are explored:

Basic RNN Layer: A single RNN layer for processing sequences.

Stacked RNNs: Multiple RNN layers to capture more complex patterns in the data.

Sequence Outputs: Configurations where RNNs return outputs for each time step, enabling more detailed analysis of sequential data.

3. IMDB Sentiment Analysis

The IMDB dataset, which consists of movie reviews labeled as positive or negative, is used to demonstrate the practical application of RNNs. The dataset is preprocessed to standardize input lengths, and models are trained to classify the sentiment of reviews.

4. Advanced RNN Architectures

In addition to SimpleRNN, the project includes implementations of more sophisticated architectures like LSTMs and Bidirectional LSTMs. These models address limitations of basic RNNs, such as vanishing gradients, and improve performance on sequential tasks.

5. Training and Visualization

Both SimpleRNN and LSTM models are trained on the IMDB dataset. Training and validation accuracy and loss are tracked over multiple epochs. These metrics are visualized to evaluate the models’ learning progress and generalization capabilities.
