# Simple-RNN-Model
This project focuses on understanding the fundamentals of Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs) by building a simple RNN from scratch using Numpy and implementing RNN-based models with the Keras library. The goal is to provide a hands-on experience with RNNs and their applications, particularly in sequential data processing tasks.
